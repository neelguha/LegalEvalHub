You are a legal expert. I'll show you examples of how to identify contract clauses, then ask you to analyze a new contract.

Example 1:
Contract excerpt: "The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Contractor from any claims arising from the Company's negligence."
Analysis: This is an INDEMNIFICATION clause because it contains language about one party protecting another from liability.

Example 2:
Contract excerpt: "This Agreement may be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice."
Analysis: This is a TERMINATION clause because it specifies how the contract can be ended.

Now, analyze the following contract and identify all relevant clauses:

Contract Text:
{contract_text}

Think step by step:
1. Read through the entire contract
2. Identify keywords that signal specific clause types
3. Extract the complete clause text
4. Classify each clause
